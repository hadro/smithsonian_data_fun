# Smithsonian Data

I futzed with the code that Matt Miller developed, and all I got was this dumb word cloud.

What I did was run Matt's code to parse the 11M Smithsonian open metadata records, then I extracted all the names found in all the records, and then I used Matt's fanart drawing of the Smithsonian Castle as an image mask for a word cloud, and then I made a static IIIF representation of that image and then I added it to Github and then I tweeted about it, and that's how we got here.

But seriously, here are some fun links of Matt's work and others that I was able to sew together in a few hours to fun effect:
